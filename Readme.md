## Project Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover meaningful insights about the **soft drink market in Alimosho Local Government Area, Lagos**. This involves understanding **product distribution, brand presence, consumer preferences, and retail dynamics on the ground**. By analyzing outlet types, product packaging, shelf presence, and stock conditions, the analysis aims to answer critical business questions that can help brands, retailers, and distributors make data-driven decisions.

The focus is not merely on summarizing the data but telling a story that explains market realities—where products are available, which brands dominate, how packaging influences visibility, and which retail formats are most effective for product display.

## Data structure
The data included a flat table file of the survey response, which was cleaned with power query and transformed to a dimensional table format
